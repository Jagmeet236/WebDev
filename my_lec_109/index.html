    <div class="box">
        <p class="p1">As we know div is a block element,<br>
    This div is by default is a block element, means it takes whole width
    of the screen and element after that will be displayed in the new line.<br> But we change it's default value to make it inline element like this paragraph tag and again we can make the paragraph tag inline <br>as we also know &lt;p&gt; tag is also a block element.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="box box2"> hi i am box two
    we can change it's display property like display-inline but there are problem with this we can give or changes it width and height and also changes it position.
</div>
<span class="sp1">hi i am the span tag and i am an inline tag</span><span class="sp2">yeah he is right</span>
<div class="box box3">
<p>The display: inline property prevents width from having an effect.
    so we don't use this property, instead use display:inline-block property.
    whose width and height can be controlled or modified and also can changes it position.

<sp class="sp1">hi i am the span tag</sp><span class="sp2">yeah he is right</span><span class="sp1">you can add many spans</span>
