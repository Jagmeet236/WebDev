    <h1>Css Selectors</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span>This is the first Div</span>
            This paragraph tag is the child of the this div and we can style this 'p' tag using child selector and this
            <strong>'child selector'</strong> works only if this para tag is the direct child of the parent tag which in
            this case is the div. if we want to select the span tag we cannot select it this like this div &gt; span
            because the styling will not work, as this span tag is not the direct child of the div.We can use another
            way of selecting this span tag using the <strong>'descendant selector'</strong>, It selects all span
            elements or any other tag/elements that are the descendants of this div element. A descendant is a child,
            grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on.
        </p>

     <div class="div1">
    <p class="para1"> This is the div two. This 'p' tag is selected using the <strong> class selector</strong> </p>
</div>

<div id="div2">Hi, i am the div 3 and <br>i am selected by using the 
<strong>Id Selector</strong>  </div>
